The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma 
and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one 
is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. 
My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has 
three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato, except my 
second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. 

How many whole bags of potatoes do I need?
