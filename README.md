# AI Agents From Scratch

Learn to build AI agents locally without frameworks. Understand what happens under the hood before using production frameworks.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository teaches you to build AI agents from first principles using **local LLMs** and **node-llama-cpp**. By working through these examples, you'll understand:

- How LLMs work at a fundamental level
- What agents really are (LLM + tools + patterns)
- How different agent architectures function
- Why frameworks make certain design choices

**Philosophy**: Learn by building. Understand deeply, then use frameworks wisely.

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What is an AI Agent?

```
AI Agent = LLM + System Prompt + Tools + Memory + Reasoning Pattern
           ─┬─   ──────┬──────   ──┬──   ──┬───   ────────┬────────
            │           │           │       │              │
         Brain      Identity    Hands   State         Strategy
```

### Evolution of Capabilities

```
1. intro          → Basic LLM usage
2. translation    → Specialized behavior (system prompts)
3. think          → Reasoning ability
4. batch          → Parallel processing
5. coding         → Streaming & control
6. simple-agent   → Tool use (function calling)
7. memory-agent   → Persistent state
8. react-agent    → Strategic reasoning + tool use
```

### Architecture Patterns

**Simple Agent (Steps 1-5)**
```
User → LLM → Response
```

**Tool-Using Agent (Step 6)**
```
User → LLM ⟷ Tools → Response
```

**Memory Agent (Step 7)**
```
User → LLM ⟷ Tools → Response
       ↕
     Memory
```

**ReAct Agent (Step 8)**
```
User → LLM → Think → Act → Observe
       ↑      ↓      ↓      ↓
       └──────┴──────┴──────┘
           Iterate until solved
```

## 🛠️ Helper Utilities

### PromptDebugger
📁 `helper/prompt-debugger.js`

Utility for debugging prompts sent to the LLM. Shows exactly what the model sees, including:
- System prompts
- Function definitions
- Conversation history
- Context state

Usage example in `simple-agent/simple-agent.js`

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### By the end of this repository, you'll understand:

1. **LLMs are stateless**: Context must be managed explicitly
2. **System prompts shape behavior**: Same model, different roles
3. **Function calling enables agency**: Tools transform text generators into agents
4. **Memory is essential**: Agents need to remember across sessions
5. **Reasoning patterns matter**: ReAct > simple prompting for complex tasks
6. **Performance matters**: Parallel processing, streaming, token limits
7. **Debugging is crucial**: PromptDebugger shows what the model actually sees

### What frameworks give you:

Now that you understand the fundamentals, frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, or AutoGPT provide:
- Pre-built reasoning patterns
- Tool libraries
- Memory management
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Production-ready error handling
- Observability and monitoring

**You'll use them better because you know what they're doing under the hood.**
